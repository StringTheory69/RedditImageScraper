Scrapes r/memes for images and uploads to firebase

This is a reddit image scraper I built in Node.js. First it scrapes r/memes for some of the most recent memes, then downloaded the images to a local folder, and finally uploaded the images to a firebase storage bucket. I used this code to populate an MVP I created where users code vote on the best daily meme. I ran this code everyday during the QA.
